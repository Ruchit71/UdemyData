Step	Validation Activity	Description
Backup Verification	Validate the availability and integrity of database snapshots.	Confirm that database snapshots are accessible and not corrupted.
Infrastructure Tear Down	Verify removal of all specified resources.	Check GitLab pipeline logs, Azure Portal, and Terraform output to ensure APIs, containers, queues, and other resources have been successfully removed.
Evidence Capturing	Confirm evidence is captured and attached to JIRA.	Validate screenshots, logs, and Terraform output are attached to the corresponding JIRA ticket for audit purposes.
Infrastructure Rebuild	Validate recreation of all infrastructure components.	Confirm successful Terraform pipeline execution, verify all resources (APIs, storage containers, Event Hub subscriptions, etc.) are correctly recreated.
Connection Testing	Test the connection to all resources and verify health checks.	Use Postman and Splunk logs to ensure all APIs return successful responses and logs indicate system health.
Database Restoration	Validate the "Dump and Restore" process for the database.	Check that the database is successfully restored using the provided commands and schema integrity is preserved.
Database Schema Integrity	Validate schema matches expected structure.	Use database tools to compare the restored schema against the expected schema to confirm integrity.
Azure Function Connectivity	Test database connectivity from Azure Function.	Verify the Azure Function can successfully connect to the restored database.
Database Cleanup	Confirm deletion of the test database after validation.	Check that the test database instance is removed using the specified Docker commands.
Log Verification	Ensure health_check results are logged in Splunk.	Verify Splunk query results show "health_check Midas-ShadowCore dev 200" entries indicating successful health checks.
Overall Validation	Validate overall recovery capability and document the results.	Compile all evidence and testing results into a final validation report to confirm resilience and recovery capability.
